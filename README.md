# Lumastic UI

This is the repository for the component library used throughout Lumastic applications and packages.

## Getting Started

To get started contributing, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

This will build your necessary dependencies and launch the style guide server. If all goes well, you should get a message like this:

```
$ npx styleguidist server
Loading webpack config from:
~/<path>/lumastic-ui/webpack.config.js

ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:6060/
ℹ ｢wds｣: webpack output is served from undefined
ℹ ｢wds｣: Content not from webpack is served from ~/<path>/lumastic-ui
You can now view your style guide in the browser:

  Local:            http://localhost:6060/
  On your network:  http://192.168.1.42:6060/
